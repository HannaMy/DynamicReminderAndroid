## An application that helps you with chores and tasks.

### Preparations
In order to run the application, you'll need to have Android Studio installed on your computer.
Download it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhtT1BRCiARIsAGlY51Ix05T9dPbBpxcUlt1wQNHyMgQdud43W6Q1AN9Al07qbkZZKz6t9bEaAneOEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
Install the application om your personal computer, [here] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/guide-to-install-and-set-up-android-studio/) is a guide you can follow.
Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio, then either connect an Android device (with developer access) or create a virtual device in the AVD-manager in Android Studio, click [here] (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) for a guide. The application is compatible on devces that runs om Android API 19 and above, so make sure that your device is at least running on KitKat.

### Run the application
Make sure that the device you want to run the application on is connected and running. Then press the green play-button in the menubar close to the top of Adroid Studio. Yoc can also access this in Run>Run app.

The application should be installing on the device, thisd might take a minute or two so be patient. :) But as soon as thats done, the application should start. You'll see a list of "example tasks", but these are not real tasks so don't try to open them! Instead, try the application by adding your own task. There is a button in the bottom right corner with a plus sign on it. The button will take you to the detaqiled view where you can fill information about the task you want to create. Remember that this is a demo and there might be some bugs or non-implemented functions.

## Enjoy!
